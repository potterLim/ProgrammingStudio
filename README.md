# [ECE20025] Programming Studio (Spring 2025) at HGU

Welcome to the **ProgrammingStudio** repository for **[ECE20025] Programming Studio** at Handong Global University(HGU) in Spring 2025. This repository provides weekly assignments, lab exercises, and supplementary materials. Although we will briefly review C, most of the work in this course focuses on **practical applications** of concepts already introduced in two separate courses: **Java** and **Data Structures** (taught with C++).

## Course Focus

- **Refresher on C**  
  Provides a short review of core C language features already covered in previous coursework.

- **Java Practice**  
  Emphasizes practical exercises and labs that reinforce topics from the separate Java course, providing hands-on practice with object-oriented programming and related concepts.

- **Data Structures in C++**  
  Centers on the practical implementation of fundamental data structure principles introduced in the separate Data Structures course, using C++ for hands-on experience with lists, stacks, queues, trees, and more.

- **Version Control**  
  Uses Git and GitHub for source code management, collaboration, and version tracking.

- **IDEs**  
  Promotes efficient workflows and project setups in development environments such as Visual Studio Code or IntelliJ.
