# [ECE20025] Programming Studio (Spring 2025) at HGU

Welcome to the **ProgrammingStudio** repository for **[ECE20025] Programming Studio** at Handong Global University (HGU) in Spring 2025. 

The course briefly reviews the essentials of C, covering only the basics, while its primary focus is on practical lab exercises in Java and Data Structures. These labs build upon the theoretical foundations established in separate Java and Data Structures courses. Data Structures exercises are implemented using C++.

## Course Focus

- **Refresher on C**  
  Provides a short review of core C language features already covered in previous coursework.

- **Java**  
  Emphasizes practical exercises and labs that reinforce topics from the separate Java course, providing hands-on practice with object-oriented programming and related concepts.

- **Data Structures using C++**  
  Centers on the practical implementation of fundamental data structure principles introduced in the separate Data Structures course, using C++ for hands-on experience with lists, stacks, queues, trees, and more.

- **Version Control**  
  Uses Git and GitHub for source code management, collaboration, and version tracking.

- **IDEs**  
  Promotes efficient workflows and project setups in development environments such as Visual Studio Code or IntelliJ.
